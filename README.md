### CBS-Guide
#### Project Description:
CBS-Guide is an Android application developed as a volunteer project during my time as a member of the tech society/club at SSCBS, my undergraduate college. This app is designed to assist incoming freshmen in easily connecting with various societies and clubs, providing a centralized source of information.
